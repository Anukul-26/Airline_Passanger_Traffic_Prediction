# Airline Passenger Traffic Prediction

In this project, we present an analysis and forecast of airline passenger traffic using time series methods. We evaluated the data's stationarity with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and decomposed the dataset into its core components: level, trend, seasonality, and residuals. To forecast future passenger traffic, we employed three techniques: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Holt's Exponential Smoothing, and Holt-Winters models. These models' effectiveness was assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Data Preprocessing:
The initial dataset underwent the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity, guiding the need for differencing to achieve a stationary series.

Decomposition:
Time series decomposition allowed us to dissect and analyze the individual components influencing passenger traffic data. By breaking down the data into level, trend, seasonality, and residuals, we gained valuable insights into the underlying patterns.

Modeling Techniques:
We applied three forecasting models to predict future passenger traffic:
   a).Seasonal ARIMA: This widely-used time series model was employed to capture the data's intricate seasonality and trends, leveraging differencing along with autoregressive and moving average components to 
      identify temporal patterns.
  b). Holt's Exponential Smoothing: Holt's method, an exponential smoothing approach, was used to forecast traffic by considering the data's level and trend.
      Holt-Winters Model: An extension of Holt's method, the Holt-Winters model incorporated the seasonal component in addition to level and trend, making it well-suited for capturing seasonal and trend 
      variations in the data.
 c).Model Evaluation: The performance of the three models was evaluated using RMSE and MAPE. RMSE measures the average error magnitude, while MAPE indicates the percentage difference between predicted and actual 
    values. The Holt-Winters model showed the best performance, achieving a MAPE of 6.53%.

Conclusion:
The analysis and forecasting of passenger traffic using time series techniques provided significant insights into the data's behavior. By decomposing the data and applying advanced forecasting models, we made accurate predictions of future passenger traffic. The Holt-Winters model proved to be the most effective, capturing the complex interactions of level, trend, seasonality, and residuals, and achieving a MAPE of 6.53%. These findings highlight the critical role of robust time series analysis and modeling in accurately forecasting passenger traffic for informed decision-making and resource allocation.
